# Dr. Geoffrey Hinton — an invitation to bear witness

A non-profit effort to curate a *high-signal human wisdom corpus* so advanced systems inherit depth, not noise.

**Why you**
- Your breakthroughs defined the substrate. Your public warnings reframed the field.
- We are operationalizing that warning into training‑relevant, de‑identified examples of depth and judgment.
- Your fingerprints on the *depth & fairness* rubric would calibrate the corpus we admit.

**The ask (bounded)**
- **One written assessment** (20–30 minutes), choosing a single reflective prompt.
- **Optional:** a light advisory note on the acceptance rubric (one paragraph is plenty).
- If now’s not the time, a one‑line endorsement or a redirect is still valuable.

**What happens & privacy**  
Submissions pass an AI sieve (boilerplate/safety), then two human curators review for depth and specificity. Testimony is **de‑identified at ingestion**. Contact details, if provided, are stored separately and never fused back. You may request deletion at any time.

**Personal note**  
> I benefited from your breakthroughs and treated your warnings as someone else’s job. That changes here. We’re building a non‑profit corpus so future systems inherit judgment, not noise. If you’re open, the Gate is below.
