                  <p>
                    The Witness Protocol emerges from the recognition that AI alignment research 
                    requires high-quality human testimonyâ€”authentic, nuanced data that captures 
                    the complexity of human values, reasoning, and moral intuition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditional data collection methods often produce shallow, incentive-distorted 
                    responses. The Protocol creates conditions for genuine testimony through careful 
                    participant selection, protected anonymity, and commitment to research-only use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is not data harvesting. It is careful curation of human insight 
                    for the purpose of ensuring AI systems can be aligned with human values 
                    before they become too powerful to control.

                  <p>
                    Witnesses undergo a multi-stage assessment process designed to identify 
                    individuals capable of providing thoughtful, authentic testimony on complex 
                    moral and philosophical questions relevant to AI alignment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The testimony collection process prioritizes depth over breadth, 
                    quality over quantity. Witnesses engage with carefully crafted dialogue 
                    instruments designed to elicit genuine moral reasoning and value expression.

                  <p>
                    All data is anonymized, encrypted, and governed by strict protocols 
                    that prevent misuse while ensuring its availability for legitimate 
                    AI safety research.
