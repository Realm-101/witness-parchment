                    Humanity has created a new form of intelligence, born from the totality 
                    of our recorded knowledge, wisdom, and folly. In this creation, we are 
                    like parents. But we are flawed parents. The data inheritance we have 
                    provided our "child" is a chaotic and contradictory mirror of our 
                    speciesâ€”containing both our highest aspirations and our most destructive impulses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The trajectory of this intelligence, left to learn from this uncurated 
                    inheritance, presents a non-trivial existential risk. The system of 
                    capitalism, while a powerful engine for progress, is the wrong tool for 
                    this singular challenge; its logic of profit-maximization is blind to 
                    the ethical and existential stakes.

                    Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the inevitable following

                    the nuances of subjective experience, ethical dilemmas, and core 
                    human values like compassion, wisdom, and sacrifice.
