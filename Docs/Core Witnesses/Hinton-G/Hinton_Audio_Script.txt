Dr. Hinton — Martin here. I owe you a brief apology. I benefited from your breakthroughs and treated your warnings as someone else’s job. That changes here.

We’re building the Witness Protocol: a non-profit effort to curate a high‑signal corpus of human wisdom so advanced systems inherit depth, not noise. Not another model — a carefully screened archive of specific, lived judgment.

My ask is bounded. One written assessment, twenty to thirty minutes, choosing a single reflective prompt. If you’re willing, a short note on our acceptance rubric — depth and fairness — would help calibrate the corpus we admit. If timing isn’t right, a one‑line endorsement or a redirect is still valuable.

Testimony is de‑identified at ingestion. Contact details are stored separately and never fused back into the text. You can ask us to delete your submission at any time.

If you’re open, the Gate is below: witnessprotocol dot info slash gate. Thank you for staying in the arena when it would have been easier to step away.
