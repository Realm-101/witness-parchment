# Apology pattern (keep it surgical)
1) **I-statement** apology (no psychoanalysis of them; own your part).
2) **One line** of what you learned.
3) Pivot to **purpose** (what we’re building and why).
4) **Specific, small ask** + graceful exit.

A brief apology — and an invitation to encode what must not be lost

Dr. Hinton,

I owe you a brief apology. For too long I benefited from your breakthroughs while treating your public warnings as “someone else’s job.” I’m sorry for being part of a culture that takes without stewarding. Thank you for staying in the arena when it would have been easier to retire.

We’re building the Witness Protocol — a non-profit project curating a **high-signal human-wisdom corpus** as a corrective inheritance for AI.

My ask is deliberately light: a 20–30 minute written assessment (one-time) and, if you’re willing, a light advisory fingerprint on our depth-and-fairness rubric. If you’re open, I’ll send a one-pager and a private Gate link ({GateLink}). If timing isn’t right, I’ll take a one-line endorsement or a redirect to someone you recommend.

With respect,

I misread you — I was wrong (and an invitation)

Mo,

I dismissed your early work as “pop” and later realized I’d misread both the rigor and the intent. I’m sorry — you’ve been consistently, practically humane on a timeline where that’s rare.

We’re building the Witness Protocol — a non-profit project curating a **high-signal human-wisdom corpus** as a corrective inheritance for AI.

Would you consider being a Foundational Witness? The ask is a one-time 20–30 minute written assessment and, if you’re open to it, occasional advice on operationalizing compassion as a constraint in our selection rubric. If yes, I’ll send a one-pager + Gate link ({GateLink}). Either way — thank you for the clarity you bring.

I dismissed the frame and shouldn’t have — small cameo ask

Eliezer,

I ridiculed parts of your frame for years. The logic seemed “imaginary” to me; turns out I lacked the resolution to see what you were actually pointing at. I’m sorry — and I respect the stubbornness it took to keep saying it when it wasn’t fashionable.

We’re building the Witness Protocol — a non-profit project curating a **high-signal human-wisdom corpus** as a corrective inheritance for AI.

Ultra-small ask: a cameo critique. Either (a) one adversarial prompt we should add to the Gate pool, or (b) a two-sentence objection to our current selection rubric — something that would make a failure mode legible. If you’re open, I’ll send the brief + Gate link ({GateLink}).
