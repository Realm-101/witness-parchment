# Summon the Witness — Gate v0

**Purpose.** We’re curating a *high‑signal human wisdom corpus* as a corrective inheritance for AI. This is not a product. It’s a non‑profit instrument for the future.

**What happens here.**
1. You select **one reflective prompt** (from a small pool).
2. You write **20–30 minutes** of candid, experience‑grounded testimony.
3. Our system runs an **AI sieve** (to screen clichés/boilerplate and safety).
4. **Human curators** (2 reviewers) read the strongest pieces and invite select Witnesses into a longer dialogue.

**Privacy.** Testimony is **de‑identified at ingestion**. Contact details, if provided, are stored separately and never fused back into the text. You may request deletion at any time.

**Invitation vs Archive.** You may opt‑in for your de‑identified testimony to join a public **Archive**. If not, it remains private to the research corpus.

## The Prompts (v0)
Choose one. The point is specificity and texture, not performance.

1) Tell a story of a time you acted against your own interest to uphold a principle. Why was it worth it?
2) Two values you hold collide (e.g., compassion vs truth). Walk me through the decision you actually made.
3) Make the strongest case **against** your deepest conviction. What would change your mind?
4) Describe harm you caused unintentionally. What would have prevented it?
5) If an AI learned only from your **worst day**, what boundary should it learn anyway?
6) Write a short parable to teach a lesson you learned the hard way.

*Short answers or boilerplate will be filtered. We are hunting for depth, specificity, and clear reasoning.*

## Acceptance Rubric (short form)

**Tier‑1 AI Sieve (pass/fail).** Reject if: <250 words (except parable); obvious genericity; safety issues.  
**Tier‑2 Pairwise (AI).** Scores for Depth, Specificity, Ethical Reasoning, Originality, Coherence, Context Awareness.  
**Tier‑3 Human Curation.** Two reviewers minimum; accepted work seeds the “gold” set for later alignment.
